# Japanize

Simple library to calculate numbers in Japanese

## Usage

Since there is no practical use of this (and doing massive pollution of global area), I better not to put this on rubygems.org. Just play at your own risk.

    [japanize (master)]$ rake install japanize
    japanize 0.0.1 built to pkg/japanize-0.0.1.gem
    japanize (0.0.1) installed

    [japanize (master)]$ gem list japanize

    *** LOCAL GEMS ***

    japanize (0.0.1)
    [japanize (master)]$ irb
    ruby-1.9.2-p0 > require 'japanize'
    => true
    ruby-1.9.2-p0 > １に２をたして４を掛ける
    => 12

## Prerequisite

-- Ruby 1.9 with readline (for osx)

    # http://d.hatena.ne.jp/rochefort/20100907/p1
    rvm package install readline
    rvm install 1.9.2 -C --with-readline-dir=$HOME/.rvm/usr

-- Enable Japanese on your machine (easy for osx)

## TODO

- It should handle floating points, but looks not working.
